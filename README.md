# Methods I Project: Inference in Linear Regression After Variable Selection
Methods I Project, Fall 2016

Author: Andy Shi

## Description

This is my final project for Harvard Biostatistics Methods I (BIOS 232)
class. I used simulation in R to investigate the implications of
variable selection on inference in a linear regression setting. This
code contains an R package to run the simulations, as well as code to
generate the figures and the text of the report.

## Installation

If you'd like to test out the package, you can install it easily using
[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools):

    install.packages("devtools") # if necessary
    devtools::install_github("shiandy/methods1proj")

The text and code to run the report can be found in the `report`
directory.
