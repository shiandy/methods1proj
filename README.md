# Methods I Project: Inference in Linear Regression After Variable Selection
Methods I Project, Fall 2016

Author: Andy Shi

This is my final project for Harvard Biostatistics Methods I (BIOS 232)
class. I used simulation in R to investigate the implications of
variable selection on inference in a linear regression setting. This
code contains an R package to run the simulations, as well as code to
generate the figures and the text of the report.

If you'd like to test out the package, you can install it easily using
[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools)

    # if necessary
    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("shiandy/methods1proj")

The text and code to run the report can be found in the `report`
directory.

A pdf copy of the report can be found here:
